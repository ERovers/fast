# fast


Forked from bowman-lab/fast for the development of FAST-PROTAC.

Current developments:
* Updated SLURM submission script to be able to specify account and correct request for gpus.
* Created SASA.py to reproduce results from (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00737) for 1BTL - FAST-SASA
