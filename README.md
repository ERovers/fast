# fast


Forked from bowman-lab/fast for the development of FAST-PROTAC.

Current developments:
* Updated SLURM submission script to be able to specify account and correct request for gpus.
* Created SASA.py to reproduce results from (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00737) for 1BTL - FAST-SASA
* Create interface_area.py to calculate interface area between E3-ligase, target and PROTAC
* Adjusted script to allow for multiple starting conformations with different topology files and start.gro files
